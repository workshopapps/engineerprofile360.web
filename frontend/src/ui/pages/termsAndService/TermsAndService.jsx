              Skript is a tool that provides a subscription service for
              companies that want to know how good their engineers are. It is a
              software where engineers register and get various multi-choice
              questions on different topics. The tool builds a profile of each
              engineer in the form of a spider-web chart so the company knows
              where its engineers need to improve. To provide our Services (as
              defined below) through our software, or website, we need to obtain
              your agreement to our Terms of Service. These Terms of Service
              govern your use of our software. As used in these Terms of
              Service; "Skript service", "our service" "the service", means the
              personalized service provided by Skript for discovering and
              assessing Skript content, including all features and
              functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and

              with our service. Skript Evaluator (Skript, ``our``, ``we,`` or
              ``us ``) provides the services described below to you ("Services")

              1. Your Skript software subscription will continue until
              terminated. To use the Skript service you/your company must have
              Internet access and a ready device, and provide us with one or
              more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid,
              accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time,
              and which may include payment through your account with a third
              party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date,
              you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing
              cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). 2. We may
              offer several subscription plans, including subscriptions offered
              by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their
              products and services. We are not responsible for the products and
              services provided by such third parties. Some subscription plans
              may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be
              disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made
              available to you. You can find specific details regarding your
              Skript subscription by visiting the Skript.com website and
              clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages
              under your profile name.

            <h2 id="BillingandCancellation">Billing and Cancellation</h2>
            <p>
              1. Billing Cycle. The Subscription fee for the Skript service and
              any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the
              service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be
              charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date
              indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle
              will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you
              signed up for the service. In some cases, your payment date may
              change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully
              settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid
              membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit
              the Skript.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on
              the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize
              your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or
              service-related charges through various methods, including
              authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as
              soon as you register. If you signed up for Enineering360 using
              your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find
              the billing information about your Skript subscription by visiting
              your account with the applicable third party. 2. Payment Methods.
              To use the Skript service you must provide one or more Payment
              Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated
              with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined
              or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee.
              You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If payment is
              not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds,
              or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend
              your access to the service until we have successfully charged a
              valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may
              charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other
              fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax
              charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with
              your Payment Method service provider for details. 3. Updating your
              Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to
              the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using
              the information provided by the payment service providers.
              Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the
              applicable Payment Method(s). 4. Cancellation. You can cancel your
              Skript subscription at any time, and you will continue to have
              access to the Skript service through the end of your billing
              period. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments
              are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for
              any partial membership periods or unused Skript content. To
              cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for
              cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will
              automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To
              see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the
              "Account" page. If you signed up for Skript using your account
              with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your
              Skript subscription, you may need to do so through such a third
              party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable
              third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the
              Skript service through that third party. 4.5. Changes to the Price
              and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and
              the price of our service from time to time; however, any price
              changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no
              earlier than 30 days following notice to you.

              The member who created the Skript account and whose Payment Method
              is charged (the "Account Owner") is responsible for any activity
              that occurs through the Skript account. To maintain control over
              the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account
              (which would include information on the viewing history for the
              account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the
              Skript-ready devices that are used to access the service and not
              reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated
              with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and
              maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us
              relating to your account. We can terminate your account or place
              your account on hold to protect you, Skript or our partners from
              identity theft or other fraudulent activity.
