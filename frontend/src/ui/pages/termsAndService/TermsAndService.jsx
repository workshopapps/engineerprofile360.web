              Skript is a tool that provides a subscription service for 
              companies that want to know how good their engineers are. 
              It is a software where engineers register and get various 
              multi-choice questions on different topics. The tool builds 
              a profile of each engineer in the form of a spider-web chart 
              so the company knows where its engineers need to improve.
    To provide our Services (as defined below) through our software, or 
    website, we need to obtain your agreement to our Terms of Service.
    These Terms of Service govern your use of our software.
    As used in these Terms of Service;
    "Skript service",
    "our service"
    "the service", means the personalized service provided by Skript for 
    discovering and assessing Skript content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service.
    Skript Evaluator (Skript, ``our``, ``we,`` or ``us ``) provides the services described below to you ("Services") unless you live in a country or territory where it is not eligible.

            <p>
            Your Company/team must create a Business account by providing accurate, current, and complete information, including its valid legal business phone number, Company name, and other information we require. The company will keep its business account information updated. Company’s name must not: (a) be false, misleading, deceptive, or defamatory; (b) parody a third party or include character symbols, excessive punctuation, or trademark designations; or (c) infringe any trademark, violate any right of publicity, or otherwise violate anyone’s rights. We reserve the right to reclaim account names on behalf of any business or individual that holds a legal claim in those name.

            1. Your Skript software subscription will continue until terminated.
  To use the Skript service you/your company must have Internet access and a ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party.
  Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).
  2. We may offer several subscription plans, including subscriptions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their products and services.
  We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some subscription plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Skript subscription by visiting the Skript.com website and clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.

            <p>
            1. Billing Cycle.
  The Subscription fee for the Skript service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases, your payment date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the Skript.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Enineering360 using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Skript subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
  2. Payment Methods.
  To use the Skript service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
  3. Updating your Payment Methods.
  You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using the information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
  4. Cancellation.
  You can cancel your Skript subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Skript service through the end of your billing period. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused Skript content.
  To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Skript using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Skript subscription, you may need to do so through such a third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Skript service through that third party.
  4.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.

            <p>
            The member who created the Skript account and whose Payment Method is charged (the "Account Owner") is responsible for any activity that occurs through the Skript account. To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on the viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the Skript-ready devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account. We can terminate your account or place your account on hold to protect you, Skript or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity.

You waive all special, indirect and consequential damages against us. These terms will not limit any non-waivable warranties or consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your country of residence.
